- 👋 Hi, I’m Antonis (@itsantonis)! Also known as Antonios Triantafyllakis, which is my full name. I currently live in Berlin, Germany, but I consider myself a global citizen.
- 👀 I’m a Learning Designer and Gamification Coach. That's the title I've come up with to describe what I mostly do professionally, which is designing engaging learning experiences for young people to develop skills relevant for thriving in the 21st century on the one hand, and consulting or coaching purpose-oriented businesses, teachers and trainers on how to best combine gamification with experiential learning to increase engagement in their own products or services. That way I multiply my impact and contribute to my vision for a world where everyone has equal rights and opportunities and is equipped with the skills to make a difference and build a sustainable future for everyone.
- 🌱 On top of that I volunteer (read: a lot) for unconditional basic income (a practical policy that can empower everyone to bring their own change), perform various activities around climate change from both a professional and volunteer perspective, do podcasting, music, and a variety of creative activities. Tn general I try to combine my professional and my personal life towards my purpose. I really crave to see a world where equality and sustainability are not just buzzwords but reality.
- 💞️ If any of the above strikes a chord, reach out to me and see how we could collaborate to bring a positive change together!
